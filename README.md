# kflow

A system for helping the CTO get a LOT done.

The premise on which kflow was built is that in order to be a great CTO, the CTO must be a writer. A builder, not of technology, but of knowledge. An employee, not of the CEO, but of themselves. Perhaps not even of themselves, but of their knowledge. A servant, not of the system, but of their greater selves.
