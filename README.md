# kflow

A system for helping the CTO get a LOT done.

The premise on which kflow was built is that in order to be a great CTO, the CTO must be a writer. A builder, not of technology, but of knowledge. An employee, not of the CEO, but of themselves. Perhaps not even of themselves, but of their knowledge. A servant, not of the system, but of their greater selves.

The irony of being a great employee when you work yourself to death, to please an objective which could be wrapped inside a doomed culture, or an erratic founder. What will you have left when you have spent hours and days and years in this environment? Perhaps you'll wish you had some equity or even a small pay out would satisfy. But this is not about that.

This is about building something for yourself. And then to watch yourself build up others. And then to see others build you up and ultimately see a legacy of impact, love and care. A life that was worth living.
