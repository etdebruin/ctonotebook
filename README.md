# CTO Notebook

A system for helping the CTO get a LOT done.

The premise on which CTO Notebook was built is that in order to be a great CTO, the CTO must be a writer. A builder, not of technology, but of knowledge. An employee, not of the CEO, but of themselves. Perhaps not even of themselves, but of their knowledge. A servant, not of the system, but of their greater selves.

There is the irony of being a great employee by working yourself to death, to please an objective which could be wrapped inside a doomed culture, or an erratic founder. What will you have left when you have spent hours and days and years in this environment? Perhaps you'll wish you had some equity or even a small pay out would satisfy. But this is not about that.

This is about building something for yourself. And then to watch yourself build up others. And then to see others build you up and ultimately see a legacy of impact, love and care. A life that was worth living.

With the CTO Notebook method, you'll move from the outside of the circle, to the center.

# Features

## CTO Levels™ Integrated

CTO Levels™ is fully integrated with CTO Notebook. When you are struggling to find your feet, or don't know where to start, simply follow the CTO Levels™ methodology. Go check out (CTO Levels™)[ctolevels.com] for more information on this framework. 

## Zettelkasten Methodology

We are firm believers in the Zettelkasten method for note taking. We'll write more about it later but for now go Google it.

## Your Second Brain

Never lose track of what you've learned or gained from working as the CTO of company. This is your personal note taking methodology that will never leave you behind ever again. Nurture and grow your expertise in a way that you'll never lose again.

## Isolated Contexts

This may not be seen as feature just yet, but each CTO engagement has it's own context. We believe this is vital in not only delivering world class work to your company, but keep that work in service to you as you move on to other engagements.

# Getting Started

The CTO Notebook system is a folder structure. You will start off by copying the folder structure to your filesystem. Once there you will start following the conventions to be the best damn CTO your company needs you to be.

## Obsidian

Currently we support Obsidian as your writing tool. We *love* Obsidian.

1. Copy the Vault folder to your filesystem. Make sure the `.obsidian` folder makes it to the destination. A simple `cp -R` should take care of it.
2. Rename the Vault folder to one that you'd prefer, perhaps call it `CTO of Acme`
3. Open Obsidian and select the folder as your Vault
4. Start CTO'ing!

## Other tools

Stay tuned for other tools with which you can deploy CTO Notebook.

# How to use

CTO Notebook is a writing tool. You'll be doing a lot of thinking and writing.

Every day. Start here.

## 1. Daily Notes

In this folder you will write down anything that comes to your mind. You won't worry about well formulated thoughts. You'll simply open a note with your favorite editor and you'll start writing.

Very important to remember this as you write a note:

1. keep your notes short.
2. these notes will most likely be thrown out once you've processed them.
3. think, GTD. just get these thoughts out of your head.

Examples of what you'll write:

1. I want to make sure that I meet with the dev team about the upcoming ERD meeting.
2. There is an interesting concept I read about regarding overall developer happiness.
3. Had a meeting with our CEO and she seemed super edgy about getting a big feature out next month. Compose some thoughts about the points she made.

Off the bat this may seem like a glorified todo list. But it's not. It's just the beginning of your composing large and beautifully thoughtful masterpieces.

_You will make sure that this folder doesn't grow too cluttered. Ideally you are processing these tiny notes once a day, or a few times a week_
